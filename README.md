Client

A React + TypeScript project using Vite.

Setup Overview

Minimal template for quick start with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and basic ESLint rules.

Two official React plugins for Vite are available:

@vitejs/plugin-react (Babel-based)

@vitejs/plugin-react-swc (SWC-based)

ESLint Recommendations

For production development, we recommend using extended ESLint rules with type-aware checks.

You can choose between standard, strict, and stylistic rule sets.

Additionally, install eslint-plugin-react-x and eslint-plugin-react-dom plugins for more precise React-specific linting.
